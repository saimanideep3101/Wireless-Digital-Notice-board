# Wireless Digital Notice Board

Welcome to the Wireless Digital Notice Board System! 🖥️📲
This project uses the LPC2148 microcontroller to display scrolling messages on a 4-panel LED matrix. Messages are sent from a smartphone via Bluetooth 📱🔗 and saved in EEPROM 💾, so they stay even after power is turned off. It’s a simple, secure 🔐, and useful system for schools 🎓, offices 🏢, or public places 🚌 — a smart way to share messages wirelessly! 🚀

## 📋 Project Overview

This project brings together multiple hardware modules to build a smart and interactive wireless display system. Here’s what it does:
🖥️ **Displays Messages**: Shows scrolling text on a 4-panel 8×8 dot matrix LED display.

📱 **Bluetooth Connectivity**: Accepts messages wirelessly from a smartphone using the HC-05 Bluetooth module.

💾 **EEPROM Storage**: Saves messages in AT24C256 EEPROM so they remain even after the device is powered off.

🔐 **Secure Message Update**: Only updates messages that come with a valid passkey (`@153Your Message$`).

🔁 **Auto-Scroll Display**: Continuously scrolls stored messages until a new one is received.

🧠 **Built on LPC2148**: Uses the ARM7-based LPC2148 microcontroller for fast and reliable control.

This system is easy to use, secure, and ideal for campuses, offices, and public spaces where digital communication is essential. 🚀

## 💡 Features
- Send text messages via Bluetooth using a passkey (e.g., `@153Message$`)
- Scroll long messages across all 4 LED matrices
- Store and retrieve messages using EEPROM (AT24C256)
- Continuously display stored messages until a new one is received
- Default message shown if EEPROM is empty

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Keil uVision** (Embedded C development)
- **Flash Magic** (Programming LPC2148)
- **Embedded C Language**

---

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Flash the firmware using Flash Magic onto LPC2148.
2. Power on the board and connect your smartphone to **HC-05**.
3. Use a terminal app to send a message like:
   ```
   @153Hello World$
   ```
4. The system will:
   - Validate the passkey
   - Store the message in EEPROM
   - Scroll it on the LED display

## 🔧 Improvements & Future Enhancements

- **LCD Integration 📟**: While this project uses 8×8 dot matrix displays, it can be extended to work with an LCD (like 16x2 or graphical LCDs) for clearer, more flexible message display.   
- **Mobile App Interface 📱**: Create a simple Android app to send and manage messages easily over Bluetooth.  
- **Multi-Language Support 🌐**: Enhance character encoding to support local languages or symbols.  
- **Power Efficiency 💡**: Use LPC2148’s low-power modes to reduce energy consumption in idle states.  
- **Message Management 🗂️**: Implement EEPROM history to view or restore previously displayed messages.
